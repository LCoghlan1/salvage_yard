<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Welcome to The Salvage Yard, your number one source for all things vintage. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of reclaimed products, with a focus on dependability, customer service and uniqueness.
Founded in 2006 by Luke Coghlan and Liz Murphy, The Salvage Yard has come a long way from its beginnings in Delwood Drive, Castleknock. When Luke and Liz first started out, their passion for finding unique goods drove them to quit their day jobs and gave them the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the world.

We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
Luke and Liz</p>
